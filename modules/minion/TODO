1. Documentation for dates

	In order to document more useful examples it would be great to know how
	setting dates works with minion, for examples such as:

		`minion remind 2014-03-06 Class at 9:15 @university`

	and being able to output all classes by entering:

		`minion dates @university`
	
2. Add command to output contents of notes in the command line.

	Should work the same as `minion open`, but insted of opening the
	file in an editor output it with the `more` command.

	Example: `minion view $FILE`
